# 3D Avatar Customizer with React Three Fiber

## Description

This project is a **3D Avatar Customizer** built using **React** and **React Three Fiber**. It allows users to create and customize a 3D avatar in real-time by changing colors, sizes, and applying predefined presets. The app leverages modern web technologies to provide an interactive and visually engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time 3D Rendering**: Powered by `@react-three/fiber` and Three.js.
- **Customizable Avatar**: 
  - Change colors of different avatar parts (head, body, arms, legs) using a color picker.
  - Adjust the size of avatar parts with intuitive sliders.
- **Presets**: Quickly apply predefined configurations for different avatar styles (e.g., Default, Robot, Athlete).
- **Save Configurations**: Export avatar configurations as a JSON file.
- **Reset to Default**: Easily revert to the default configuration.
- **Interactive Controls**: Rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D scene using orbit controls.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Three Fiber**: For 3D rendering within the React ecosystem.
